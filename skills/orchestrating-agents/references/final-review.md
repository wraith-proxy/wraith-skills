# Final Review and Finish

Part of wraith:orchestrating-agents. Every task in the plan is
complete.

The final whole-branch review gets a package too: write one as described in
[card-contract.md](card-contract.md) (MERGE_BASE = the commit the
branch started from, e.g. `git merge-base main HEAD`) and include the
printed path in the final review dispatch, so the final reviewer reads
one file instead of re-deriving the branch diff with git commands. Dispatch
on the most capable available model (see SKILL.md's Model Selection), using
the wraith:reviewer agent. Point it at
the ledger's deferred-minor and parked lines so it can triage which must be
fixed before merge.

If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent
with the complete findings list - not one fixer per finding.
Per-finding fixers each rebuild context and re-run suites; a real
session's final-review fix wave cost more than all its tasks combined.
Then run exactly one scoped re-review of the fix wave
(package over the fix range, per [card-contract.md](card-contract.md),
[re-review.md](../prompts/re-review.md)).
Adjudicate any residual findings as in the fix loop's breaker
(references/fix-loop.md): park with rulings, or rule on the load-bearing
ones and ledger what you decided. Only the four things that stop a running
plan (top of SKILL.md) stop you here. There is no second fix wave -
residual load-bearing findings surface to your human partner when
finishing-a-development-branch presents the options.

### Finish

Before you delete anything, collect every ledger line containing `Ruling:` -
preflight rulings, parked findings, breaker adjudications, all of them - into
your final message under "Rulings I made", in the order you made them, each
with what it costs if wrong. The list is exhaustive: if the ledger holds a
ruling, the list holds it. That list is the only place the decisions you
took on your human partner's behalf reach them - they read it and rework
whatever you got wrong. A ruling that dies with the workspace was a decision
made in secret.

When the final whole-branch review is clean and its fixes are merged,
delete this plan's workspace (`rm -rf <workspace>`) - the git history is
the record now. Sibling directories belong to other plans; leave them
alone.

Use wraith:ship.
